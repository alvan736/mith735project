  <h1>Research Topic:</h1>
<p>	How has the neoliberalization of space and territoriality interfered with community-led efforts in the multi-ethnic and immigrant community of Langley Park in Prince George’s County? How is racial capitalism and racialization of space infiltrating the community? </p>
o	Trying to Understand through the Langley Park archives:
<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
	 <li>What were these efforts (since the early 20th century to now)?</li>
   <li>How have the demographics changed?</li>
	<li> What caused these demographical shifts?</li>
	 <li>How has this impacted small businesses along the main corridor of LP?</li>
	<li>How has this led the transition to gentrification come into place? (this is one I have to modify more but I am thinking about the Purple Line here)</li></ul>

<b>Focus</b>: The unincorporated community of Langley Park located in Prince George’s County and a slight part in Montgomery County
-	What kind of study would this be? I am not sure yet, I am thinking along the lines of ethnography/theoretical and maybe historical if I can digitally make it interactive as well
<p></p>
<h1>Current methodology:</h1>
<p>Archives: Organizing Langley Park archives that once belonged to former Professor Bill Hanna located at the Latin American Studies Center at UMD, which will contribute to my research. These archives include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Archival documents from Prince George’s County,</li>
<li>Community Organizational plans,</li>
<li>Planning Office documents,</li>
<li>Interviews (tape and VHS),</li>
<li>Photos,</li>
<li>Reports, & Student reports,</li>
<li>Newspaper clips and articles,</li>
<li>Correspondence between community organizations and government</li>
</ul>
Current Government and Political Role
-	The archives only have documents from the mid 1970s to early 2000s. I would need to find what has been the involvement of organizations and government officials since then and the policies they have placed.
Interviews:
-	I would need to conduct interviews with current stakeholders in Langley Park, including residents, organizations, govt elected officials, developers, small business owners
-	Oral stories

<h1>Technical tools:</h1>
-	NVivo – possibly for coding documents and finding themes
-	QGIS – for maps
-	Carto/Mapbox/Leaflet – for styling of maps
-	Website – possibly WordPress where the data and findings could live and be presented to the public
-	Google Drive – to hold my data/information

<h1>Data: (for socioeconomic #’s and spatial analysis)</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Historical data – 20th century – present</li>
<li>ACS Census data</li>
<li>Former redlining maps – if available??</li></ul>

<h1>Timeline:</h1>
-	Since I am in my 2nd year of the PhD program I expect to this to take 1.5 - 2 years to organize my data and research (I could be wrong though).
-	My goal in this class is to focus on the Langley Park archives aspect and learn how I can begin organizing and digitizing the materials that will eventually be incorporated to my overall project.
