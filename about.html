  <p>About our project</p>
  <p> In the mid- 2000s, Professor Bill Hanna from the University of Maryland’s Urban Studies and Planning Program became heavily invested in the nearby community of Langley Park by chance. Late into his academic career, he came to realize one of the most densely and vulnerable populations in the D.C. metro area existed not too far away from campus. He began taking his students to Langley Park for field lessons for his Urban Planning courses where they could learn from real life opportunities. Professor Bill Hanna passed away in 2015 and left a legacy behind that still reverberates in Langley Park. His research and field study reports from Langley Park were recently donated by his wife to the Latin American Studies Center (LASC) at UMD, which will soon be relocated to the UMD library. I am currently one of the graduate students that is collaborating with LASC to digitize the Langley Park archives. The Langley Park archives would also serve my dissertation proposal, which looks into understanding how the neoliberalism of space and territoriality has interfered with community-led efforts in this particular multi-ethnic and immigrant community. Furthermore, I would like to look into the intersectionality of racial capitalism and racialization of space. 

Additional questions I have in regard to the archives and additional findings from outside sources include: 
•	What were these efforts (since the early 20th century to now)?
•	How have the demographics changed?
•	What caused these demographic shifts?
•	How has this impacted small businesses along the main corridor of LP?
•	Will gentrification come into place with the construction of the new Purple Line?
